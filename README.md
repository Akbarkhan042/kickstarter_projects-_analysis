## PROJECT OBJECTIVE

The objective of this project is to analyse the dataset containing the records of all Kickstarter projects launched during the period of 2009 - 2018 to find out the trends in number of projects launched & amount pledged to these projects over the years. We would also like to uncover different patterns present in the dataset like which category had the most amount pledged, which country launched the most number of projects etc.
